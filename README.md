# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI (Minimax Algorithm)  

📝 Description  
This is a **Tic-Tac-Toe game** implemented in Python using Pygame for the GUI and the "Minimax Algorithm" for an unbeatable AI opponent. The game allows a player to compete against an AI that makes optimal moves based on the Minimax strategy.  

🚀 Features  
✅ Play as **X** or **O**  
✅ AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves  
✅ Interactive GUI built with Pygame  
✅ Detects win, loss, or tie conditions  
✅ Option to restart the game after completion  

🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pygame (for the graphical interface)  
- Minimax Algorithm (for AI decision-making)
